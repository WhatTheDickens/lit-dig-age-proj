               <line>here. Try to capture additions (insertions)</line>
               <line>and deletions (cancellations). An example would be something like this: The mass of</line>

               <!-- Another thing you should know. Sometimes Thoreau draws a vertical line through an entire passage or even through a whole page. This kind of mark isn't a deletion. He does this to indicate to himself that he's carried the passage over to a subsequent draft or another part of the current draft. If you come across and example and want to encode it, the right way to do it is: <metamark function="used" rend="line" /> -->
