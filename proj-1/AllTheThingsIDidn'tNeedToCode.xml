               <line>This is a delicious evening, when the whole body <add>seems to be</add> one sense,</line>
               <line>and imbibes delight through every pore. I go and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a part of herself.</line>

               <line>I have, as it were, my own sun and moon and stars, and a little world all to myself. At night there was never a traveller passed my house, or knocked at my door, mre than if I were the first or last man;</line>
               <line>unless it were in the spring, when some came occasionally from the village to fish for pouts in the pond, and,—they plainly fished much more in Walden Pond of their own natures, and baited their hooks with darkness, —but they soon retreated,</line>
               <line>usually with light baskets, and left "the vale to solitude and me," and the dark kernel of the night was never profaned by any human neighborhood.</line>
               <line> I believe that men are generally still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are <add rend= "pencil">all</add> hung, and Christianity and candles <del rend= "strikethrough">are</del><add rend= "pencil">have been</add> invented.</line>
